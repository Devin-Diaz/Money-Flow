1. Set up Spring Boot project with needed dependencies. Typically:
	- Spring Web

	- Front end (Thyme-leaf because I'm trash)

2. Create Model class and construct table within class that will be used for DB

3. Connect to DB via application properties and do testing to ensure everything is in sync 
	- spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/name_of_db
	- spring.datasource.username=user
	- spring.datasource.password=password

4. Create repository, service, and DTO interfaces / implementations 

5. Begin creating controller with needed mappings. Go to functions should be landing page and register pages

6. Start creating frontend templates that will be linked with the controller and model's fields

7. Do testing to ensure frontend is working as intended and data is being saved to DB via backend 

7. Begin working on security
